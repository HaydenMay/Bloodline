# Bloodline — Build Roadmap

Companion to [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and [TRAITS.md](TRAITS.md).

See [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md) for a detailed record of design iterations and lessons learned.

See [NEXT_PLAN.md](NEXT_PLAN.md) for the active working roadmap for upcoming work.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
**~1 session** · live at https://haydenmay.github.io/Bloodline/

Delivered: Vite + TS scaffold, ESLint-enforced `sim/` isolation (verified against a deliberate violation), seeded deterministic RNG, versioned save schema with migrations and export/import, GitHub Actions deploy gated on lint + test + build, LICENSE and CREDITS. 16 tests passing, 0 vulnerabilities. Production build confirmed serving from `/Bloodline/`.

---

## Phase 1 — The race simulation, headless
**~2–3 sessions** · *the most important phase in the project*

✅ **COMPLETE** — Headless deterministic race simulation with balance harness.

---

## Phase 2 — One playable race
**~3–4 sessions** · **Milestone 1** · *all deliverables landed*

✅ **COMPLETE** — Playable race with horse rig, coat genetics, track, HUD, and input controls.

---

## Phase 3 — A full career
**~3–4 sessions** · ✅ **COMPLETE**

Delivered: Starter selection with six horses (pool scaling with stable prestige), training weeks with condition/form/breakthroughs and **potential ceilings**, the **age arc** — growth at 2–3, peak at 4, decline at 5 — **injuries** including the career-ending case, **rest weeks**, race calendar with 2–3 upcoming races, divisions with points-based promotion/demotion, ~70 AI horses across divisions, save/load, auto-race/skip, championship victory scene with podium, **player-called retirement** with the trainer hinting once decline sets in, career recap, and **retirement into bloodstock**.

**Deliverable:** one horse, start to retirement, 18–20 starts. ✅

> **Corrected after audit.** This section previously claimed condition, form,
> injuries and 18–20-start retirement as delivered while the summary table
> marked the phase in progress. Injuries and the form state had never been
> written, potentials were generated and read by nothing, age never advanced,
> and retirement was hardcoded to force at exactly 20 starts. Those are now
> built. Remaining known gap: **multiple save slots** (§13) — a single slot
> plus export/import ships today.

---

## Phase 4 — The stable
**~2–3 sessions**

✅ **Cash and Reputation as separate currencies** — both live on the stable, not the career
✅ **Seven facilities, five levels each** — with real effects, gated by stable prestige
✅ **Trainer and Jockey, levelling, capped by Reputation**
✅ **Consumables** — upkeep items and one-race race-day items
✅ **Retirement, Legacy scoring, Hall of Fame** — horse legacy banks into stable prestige on retirement
✅ **The permanent rival dossier** — head-to-head records surviving across careers
✅ **Wagering on your own horse** — win and place, priced off the field

**Deliverable:** careers connect. Run 2 opens stronger than run 1.

---

## Phase 4.5 — Re-balance and physics
**~2–3 sessions** · *a correction pass, not a feature*

All known defects and tuning passes listed in this phase are **documented in [HISTORY.md](HISTORY.md)** for reference.

✅ **Speed scale corrected**  
✅ **Energy floor fixed**  
✅ **Noise re-balanced**  
✅ **Harness re-verified**  
✅ **Animation synchronized**  

**Deliverable:** finishes you would believe. Photo finishes at the front, a beaten field that is beaten rather than distanced.

---

## Phase 5 — Breeding
**~3–4 sessions** · *the payoff*

Sliced into stages that each leave the game playable, because "the loop closes" is worth having
early and everything after it is texture on top.

### Stage 1 — The budget and the foal
- `sim/breeding.ts`: retired career → inheritance budget → distributed foal
- Floor from the parents, budget from achievement, variance from pairing diversity
- First-cross bonus, rolled once per pairing so rerolling cannot farm it
- Pairing screen showing **projected potential ranges and nothing else** (§10)
- New careers start from a foal or from a yearling

**Deliverable: the loop closes.** Retire, breed, race the foal.

### Stage 2 — Partners and the cash sink
- Stud fees, scaling with a partner's calibre — the sink that keeps cash meaningful after the
  unlock ladder is exhausted
- Own Hall of Fame horses free forever, and carrying a budget bonus
- Retired horses keep ageing into ineligibility

### Stage 3 — Genetics texture
- Coat genetics with real dominant/recessive inheritance
- Traits and distance aptitude inheriting separately, with their own mutation chance
- Grandparents, linebreeding, and gradual inbreeding narrowing
- Rejected foals sold, and released into the world as rivals

### Stage 4 — The archive
- **CK3-style pedigree tree.** First-class screen, not a submenu
- Procedural naming with the dedupe and quality safeguards

### Stage 5 — Foal development
- The EV-style allocation pass

### Decisions taken before building

| Question | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| What the budget converts from | **Banked legacy + the parents' finishing potentials** | §10 also listed wins, divisions and titles, but legacy already weights those by division — counting both would score a Championship win two or three times. One economy, one spine |
| Stallion/mare dead end | **Outside studs in Stage 1, free for now** | Bloodstock is only what you retired, so two colts in a row would otherwise leave a player unable to breed at all. Charging for them is Stage 2's job |
| Pedigree depth | **Parents only in Stage 1** | Grandparents arrive with Stage 3. A gen-2 foal has no grandparents in the yard yet, so nothing is lost by waiting |
| The new-horse screen | **Breed or buy, with buying explicitly weaker** | Breeding is the intended path (§1); a yearling gets stable-scaled stats and inherits nothing. The escape hatch stays open when a line goes bad |

§10 says reputation unlocks higher-calibre outside partners. Reputation no longer exists — prestige
gates them.

### To measure once Stage 1 lands
What a gen-3 and gen-5 horse actually banks. Two open numbers depend on it and neither should be
touched before: whether the Hall of Fame at 1,000 is reachable, and whether the prestige walls
(Novice 0 / Professional 400 / Elite 1,500 / Champion 3,500 / Legend 7,500) need moving out.
Current estimates assume every horse banks what a generation-1 horse banks, which is exactly what
breeding is built to falsify.

## Phase 6 — Polish
**~3+ sessions, open-ended**

- Full race-day soundscape and stable ambience
- Five tracks, weather, going, crowd density scaling
- Accessibility pass — colourblind palettes, reduced motion, text scaling, speed controls
- PWA, offline, mobile performance tuning
- UI polish — responsive sizing, screen transitions, visual refinements
- Codex: racing manual and breeding manual
- Opening sequence
- Difficulty tiers verified through the harness

---

## Known issues

### Winning margins are too wide

**Currently ~3.7L between first and second**, down from 4.1L. Real racing is decided by 1–3, and 5+ is a rout. The tail is the bigger problem (60L instead of 74.7L, but still wide).

**What's left:** Another iteration of the same loop — cut noise further, re-verify style balance, re-check the tail — not a new mechanism.

### Position costs more than it returns

✅ **Fixed in Phase 4.5** (the establish double-charge, the misfit energy relief, and the softened AI reserve clause). Kept as a reference record for how the fix was diagnosed.

## If we need to cut

In order of what goes first:

1. Five tracks → one track with varied conditions
2. Wagering
3. Consumables
4. Foal development phase → automatic allocation
5. Difficulty tiers → ship Standard only

**Never cut:** the balance harness, the energy economy, the pedigree archive. Those are the spine.
